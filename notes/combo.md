# Combo Weapon Changes

I have altered almost every single combo weapon in the game to utilize magazines. This seems like more of an oversight than anything. Or maybe Blue Castle / CV simply wanted people to spend an obnoxious amount of time finding weapon combinations. Whichever may be the case, here's the table:

## Photo proof of concept

> ### So far, only those items shown have been tested thoroughly. I welcome feedback on what items do or don't work from other users.

### Additional tidbits

1. Magazine choices should be somewhat obvious, based on the core components used to make the combo weapon in question.
2. Looking in the game's source, the developers put wheelchair as both a `Domestic` and `Sports` object.
	* Originally I was going to repurpose and edit an underutilized magazine to apply it specifically to wheelchair items, but having found that out on accident, I now no longer need to.
3. Nothing else quite fit here, so it only uses the `Toy` property due to the required water gun.
4. I mean, it's a Rambo bear. Come on. 'Murica.
5. Easily the most overused weapon by virtually all players. It's already durable in vanilla. I really wanted to make it three magazines to match vanilla `Baseball Bat`, but that would've been overkill, I feel, and made PP farming even easier than it already is.
