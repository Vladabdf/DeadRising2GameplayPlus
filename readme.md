This mod was originally made to try and fix the game's luminance variation problem, but eventually turned into something a little bit more.

A lot of players on weaker hardware even in 2024 have a hard time handling this game. (This is probably the only time I'll acknowledge Steam's toxic forums.)

Furthermore, the only guide online to disabling some of the slightly intensive (and honestly annoying) effects was posted to the [PCGamingWiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Dead_Rising_2). However, the caveat to using those methods to disable these effects relied on the user playing unauthorized retail copies of DR2.

I began posting edits to the PCGW page for DR2 on how people can alter those effects themselves, but they were long and likely would be confusing for the average user. While a couple of my changes still remain on that wiki right now, I will not be posting further changes, as it would honestly be easier to just simply download a file and plop it in your game folder. So, that's what you can do.

## Yay.

### Note to PCGamingWiki

I love PCGW. I go to it immediately any time I install a game, new or old, to see what fixes or changes I can make to improve my gaming experience. However, I also notice a lot of binaries are shared directly to PCGW with no link, info, or knowledge on who the creator of said binaries are. Please do not do that with me. If you want to share the binary in question (`datafile.big`) from my `Releases` page, just link people here. Don't upload the thing to your server with no info.

Thanks.
