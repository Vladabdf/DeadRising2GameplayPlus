# Vladabdf's Visual Edits to Dead Rising 2

## Changes made

| Effect | Disabled | Enabled | Altered | Description |
|--------|----------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Depth of Field | :heavy_check_mark: | - | - | Low quality background blur of the world. |
| Game world fog | :heavy_check_mark: | - | - | Likely made to mask item pop-in on the original Xbox 360 hardware the game was made for. | 
| Screen vignette | :heavy_check_mark: | - | - | Cinematic, or whatever. |
| Game blur fx | :heavy_check_mark: | - | - | Even with the in-game toggle off, many blur effects remain. | 
| Luminence variation | :heavy_check_mark: | - | - | This game is notorious for wildly shifting luminence coverage depending on exactly which spot Chuck is standing at. |
| Field of View | - | - | :heavy_check_mark: | Default FOV is narrow. Now it's not. |

This mod was originally made to try and fix the game's luminance variation problem, but eventually turned into something a little bit more.

A lot of players on weaker hardware even in 2024 have a hard time handling this game. (This is probably the only time I'll acknowledge Steam's toxic forums.)

Furthermore, the only guide online to disabling some of the slightly intensive (and honestly annoying) effects was posted to the [PCGamingWiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Dead_Rising_2). However, the caveat to using those methods to disable these effects relied on the user playing unauthorized retail copies of DR2.

I began posting edits to the PCGW page for DR2 on how people can alter those effects themselves, but they were long and likely would be confusing for the average user. While a couple of my changes still remain on that wiki right now, I will not be posting further changes, as it would honestly be easier to just simply download a file and plop it in your game folder. So, that's what you can do.

## Yay.
